Hey, peeps, Ai here! It's a crazy world out there, so here's a quick guide on how not to get lost when applying to a raid.

For starters, these raids will mostly have the following emoji attached to them:
✅ = would like to take part in the raid
✔ = would like to take part in the raid, but only if there's enough slots (fill)
❓ = would like to take part in the raid, but not sure if I can make it on time
📖 = would like to take part in the raid, but am new to it

For practice runs, these emojis change their meaning slightly to:
✅ = would like to take teach others the mechanics of the raid
✔ = would like to help with damage/required roles
📖 = would like to learn the raid mechanics

One last thing to take into account is that there is a 30 min deadline before raids for sign ups. So, if you want to take part into a certain raid, make sure to sign up for it ahead of time.
That would be all folks, take care now! ♥
