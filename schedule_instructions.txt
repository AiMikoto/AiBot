Hi peeps, lil' Ai here. It's a crazy world out there, so here's a quick guide on how not to get lost when applying to a raid.
First things first, how should you react to these raids?

Well, most of these raids will have one of the 4 following emoji under them:
✅ = would like to take part in the raid
✔ = would like to take part in the raid, but only if there's enough slots (fill)
❓ = would like to take part in the raid, but unsure if I can make it on time
📖 = would like to take part in the raid, but am new to it

Now, those all seem pretty straightforward, right? So, what about those extra icons you might encounter?

Well, for starters, in the case of a post that includes multiple raids it just specifies which raid you might want to attend.
That can be either due to gearscore restrictions, or personal interests, no one's judging you.
As for the remainder, they just specify which roles you would be able to fill in that specific raid.

One last thing to take into account is that there is a 30 min deadline before raids for sign ups. So, if you want to take part into a certain raid, make sure to sign up for it ahead of time.
That would be all folks, take care now! ♥
